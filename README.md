Hot Spots

Originally intended to aggregate Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram geolocation data in order to allow users to discover the "hot spots" of a particular area. Due to time constraints and techonological barriers, HotSpots is only capable of gathering Facebook Checkins, and displaying a heat map of checkins. 

This is my first project at Coding Dojo. It is built using PHP's MVC Framework CodeIgniter with a MySQL database. Facebook and Google Maps API were integrated in order to create a heatmap displaying where users' friends have been.
